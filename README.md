With xlf files this exyension help to do this:

> Don´t type in the target .xlf file.
> Don´t translate twice. If you already translated, or NAV did it “Posting Date” to “Fecha registro”, I think that you don´t have to do it again….never.

I see the steps:
1.	Begin translation getting the original English .xlf file. From this file we can extract what to translate and remove the duplicates captions. We save in a json object the distinct captions to translate
2.	The second step is using the previous work saved in old .xlf files: the NAV standard xlf file, the .xlf translation generated by txt2Al translator, or other apps .xlf files you want to use.
3.	After this previous step, I have a lot of translation done working almost nothing. The next thing I want to have are the remaining translation, without duplicates in an Excel file to end the work. This must be the only manual work in the process 
4.	The final step must be building the final xlf in the target language: the file must be done merging the original file, previous translation files and our manual final translations in the Excel plain file text files with tabulations.

We made a VSCode extension to manage translation driven by a json file to do these four steps. We generate, 
### Step 1
    "OriginalXlfFile": [
        {"SkipStep": false},
        {"Path": "C:/Users/Jesus/Documents/AL/WarehouseAssistant/Translations/WarehouseAssistant.g.xlf"
This step starts with the English .xlf process. Here we must set the file generated in our first package generation with:

This steps process this .xlf and create a json file, with original captions without duplicates and waiting for translations in target properties:

        "source": "Ask for needs Intent",
        "target": ""
    },
    {
        "source": "End Scan Lots Intent",
        "target": ""

The json file is for internal use of the extension is showed here for didactical purpose.

### Step 2

The step 2 feed the target translation from previous translation files:
    "PreviousTranslationsFiles": [
        {"SkipStep": false},
        {"Files": [
                {"Path": "C:/Users/Jesus/Documents/AL/WarehouseAssistant/Translations/WarehouseAssistant.g copy.xlf"},
            	   {"Path": "C:/Users/Jesus/Documents/Spanish language (Spain).Source/Translations/Base Application.es-ES.xlf"}
The first one is the translations that we have after the txt2al process. The second one is the standard Spanish translation of all the app. This way with the first one I get all I have translated in 140 version, and with the second we avoid repeating common NAV translations, you know what I mean, “Posting date”, “Document No.”, “Item No.” “Location Code” and so on.

### Step 3

In this step, we create a excel plain text file, with the remaining expressions we have not translated in the previous steps.
    "RemainigTranslationsFile": [
        {"SkipStep": true},
        {"Path": "C:/Users/Jesus/Documents/AL/WarehouseAssistant/ReminTrans.csv"}

If we open the file with excel you can see the columns:

### Step 4

When you finish the remaining translations of excel plain text with tabulations file, come the  moment to make final .xlf file:
    "FinalXlfFile": [
        {"SkipStep": false},
        {"Path": "C:/Users/Jesus/Documents/AL/WarehouseAssistant/Translations/WarehouseAssistant.ES.xlf"}
Here we only set the path of the final Spanish (or your local language) file. But only a language.
Creating a translation step file

## Features

For this purpose, you only have to create a new .json file (Ctrl+N and save as any name with json extension in the workspace folder) and type new snippet JAMCreatetransfile:

## Requirements

Visual Studio with AL language.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `TargetLanguage`: Set the target language code. Default `es-ES`
* `JSONTranslationFilename`: Set here if you like another file name for temp json object than `JSONTranslation.json`. Not needed.

## Known Issues

Remember don´t use in the .json file “\” patch separator use “/” instead. I will fix this little issue soon, but right now is what is.
